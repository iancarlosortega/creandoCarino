## Migration to Angular 17

This project was originally created with Angular 13, so I decided to migrate it to Angular 17 to take advantage of the new features and improvements of the framework and here are the steps I followed:

- Update Angular CLI to the latest version
- Update Angular to the latest version
- Update all the dependencies to the latest version
- Update the Firebase version
- Update the Angular Material version
- Update the Angular Fire version
- Migrate from traditional NgModules to StandaloneComponents

Also, I left both versions of the project in different branches:

- **Angular 13:** master branch
- **Angular 17:** v17 branch
